This document provides details of an evaluation of an OBA water pilot in Kampala, Uganda, which serves as an illustration of what a challenging endeavor impact evaluation can be. Its preliminary findings shed light on the challenges of estimating the nature and magnitude of the effects of an innovative water provision scheme, especially in the context of urban slums. Detailed herein are the pioneer case study and the evaluation of OBA pilot projects.},

	abstract = {Given the broad array of issues and
 the complexity faced by the water sector as a whole (from
 irrigation to flood protection, to water conservation and
 hydropower), there is great demand for future exploring the
 potential of RBF and tackling the questions still unanswered
 about many of its operational dimensions. This document
 takes a closer look at some of the practical aspects of
 implementing various RBF water schemes. Chapter 2 provides
 an analytical framework to explore if and when RBF can be a
 viable option, shedding light on some key factors and
 preconditions that are necessary for RBF to work--with the
 understanding that it can be used either as an alternative
 or a complement to a more traditional input-based funding
 scheme. Chapter 3 then revisits the concepts discussed in
 the analytical framework through the analysis of various
 case studies of RBF approaches in different water-related
 areas. Some of the case studies are based on actual projects
 already implemented or ongoing, while others are an
 illustrative elaboration, given the lack of practical cases
 to use as sources. Chapter 4 presents some conclusions and
 lessons learned. The key challenges that are likely to be
 encountered in designing an RBF scheme deal with: the
 clarity and level of certainty of the relationships from
 input to output to outcomes (causal links); the ease and
 availability of measurable indicators; and, consequently,
 the optimal determination of the necessary incentive(s) to
 align the goals of the principal with the agents'
 deliverables. Appendix A presents a glossary of RBF concepts
 and acronyms. Appendix B presents specific results and
 indicators which may be relevant for different sectors.},

	abstract = {This report originated as a contribution to the “Program of Integrated Public Policies for the Youth,” through which the IDB is supporting the Brazilian Municipality of Fortaleza in fostering socio-economic inclusion for young people in disadvantaged contexts. 
The first contribution of the study is to offer a synthetic outline of the issues and challenges relative to social and productive exclusion of young people, distinguishing between developed and developing regions, with special attention to Brazil. The report identifies and outlines, with empirical evidence, the following five macro-challenges that youth employment currently poses to countries like Brazil. Namely: (a) insufficient educational attainment and quality; (b) poverty, vulnerability, and youth at risk; (c) mismatch in labor supply and demand; (d) lack of opportunities and high incidence of informality; and (e) expected labor market effects of the ongoing crisis.
Against such a framework, the study identifies and describes eight worldwide best practices in the field of youth employment policies. The choice of the case studies maintains an explicit focus on programs with an emphasis on the promotion of self-employment and entrepreneurship as alternative tools to tap an existing under-exploited young entrepreneurial potential, in a context of shrinking labor demand from the public and formal sector. 
The identified most successful and sustainable programs (retrieved in a variety of different contexts) consistently show some common key success factors. In particular, they exhibit an emphasis on selection and targeting (according to age, education level, and access to credit, business networks, and tools); a “person-centered” approach (as opposed to “product-” or “policy-centered”); and a proper combination of business-related and training initiatives. A documented barrier is often the lack of coordination between public agencies, at different levels, with the private sector and local civil society representatives. Additionally, in the Brazilian context, it seems utterly important to balance efforts between measures that increase the labor welfare for all, while simultaneously striving to improve the business environment and incentivize microenterprises to register.},
