	abstract = {This systematic review of urban planning studies in developing countries found that top-down efforts are ineffective for connecting populations to centralised water, sanitation or electricity services. Bottom up, participatory approaches are effective for local sanitation solutions, but not for water supply or connectivity to other services.
Services provided by public or private agencies through centralised planning and implementation (top-down) appeared effective in individual studies for connecting populations to water, sanitation and electricity. However, where studies were sufficiently similar to justify pooling findings in a statistical meta-analysis, this conclusion was not confirmed. Qualitative synthesis of contextual factors suggest a need for the customisation of solutions to meet local needs, and better delivery of services by alternative/non-government service providers.
Participatory (bottom-up) approaches adopted by NGOs and CBOs suit the construction and maintenance of toilets, which can be standalone, and statistical meta-analysis confirms their effectiveness for individual but not community toilets. Although studies of bottom-up approaches to improving water access appeared positive more often than studies of top down approaches, this difference was not statistically significant in a meta-analysis. Moreover, bottom-up approaches suffer from problems of scaling-up. Replication of successful models may not always be possible, since the same conditions may not be present in different locations.
Neighbourhoods without security of tenure are rarely served well top-down. Bottom-up approaches are also limited in this context, and also in Africa where efforts may be hampered by particularly modest levels of economic development. Public-private partnerships show promise for top-down approaches to improving water supply. Bottom-up, NGO led initiatives for improving water supply need the cooperation and support of the public sector.},

	abstract = {Given the broad array of issues and
 the complexity faced by the water sector as a whole (from
 irrigation to flood protection, to water conservation and
 hydropower), there is great demand for future exploring the
 potential of RBF and tackling the questions still unanswered
 about many of its operational dimensions. This document
 takes a closer look at some of the practical aspects of
 implementing various RBF water schemes. Chapter 2 provides
 an analytical framework to explore if and when RBF can be a
 viable option, shedding light on some key factors and
 preconditions that are necessary for RBF to work--with the
 understanding that it can be used either as an alternative
 or a complement to a more traditional input-based funding
 scheme. Chapter 3 then revisits the concepts discussed in
 the analytical framework through the analysis of various
 case studies of RBF approaches in different water-related
 areas. Some of the case studies are based on actual projects
 already implemented or ongoing, while others are an
 illustrative elaboration, given the lack of practical cases
 to use as sources. Chapter 4 presents some conclusions and
 lessons learned. The key challenges that are likely to be
 encountered in designing an RBF scheme deal with: the
 clarity and level of certainty of the relationships from
 input to output to outcomes (causal links); the ease and
 availability of measurable indicators; and, consequently,
 the optimal determination of the necessary incentive(s) to
 align the goals of the principal with the agents'
 deliverables. Appendix A presents a glossary of RBF concepts
 and acronyms. Appendix B presents specific results and
 indicators which may be relevant for different sectors.},

	abstract = {In Brazilian urban favelas, the development of informal connections is common,
relatively easy to obtain, and allow citizens to acquire electricity eluding or reducing
the regular charging of consumption. Genuine affordability problems and limited
means of subsistence are the most important but not exhaustive explanation of theft
and nonpayment problems afflicting energy distribution companies. With a preliminary
evaluation of the project “Conviver: energia para viver melhor”, implemented in Belo
Horizonte, this thesis studies the determinants of illegal connections and energy fraud
in the context of low-income urban favelas. Using the tecnique of logistic regression,
the study illustrates how the probability of engaging in illegal behavior is explained by
the following concurring factors: inadequate energy provision and lacking equipment;
income and affordability; inefficient and incorrect use of domestic electric appliances.
Additionally, based on the Conviver sample of 15,279 households, the thesis provides
an evaluation of the effectiveness of different pro-poor schemes (government poverty
subsidies and electricity block tariffs) at subsidizing energy costs for poor customers.
The analysis proves that social tariffs, even though not exclusively responsible, can be
considered as factors that mitigate the occurrence of illegality. The type of social tariffs
that work better are the ones that are more strictly connected to consumption, as
opposed to those linked to poverty subsidies. This make a strong case for a “tariff
engineering” that takes into serious account the electricity needs in term of
consumption, and try to segment the customers to realistically match the actual needs
(minimum; low-medium; houses with micro-businesses in the dwelling). As the
preliminary outcomes of the Conviver program document, the positive effect of propoor
tariff schemes will be even multiplied if combined with effort for the orientation
of low-income customers to energy-saving behaviors.},

	abstract = {Indian cities have large populations of urban slum dwellers who lack access to basic services from utility providers. Many households obtain access to electricity through illegal connections, which can be unsafe and contribute to commercial distribution losses at utilities. To address this challenge, the Indian electricity act of 2003 introduced a provision to increase formal access by requiring electric utilities to connect and supply any customer who can provide proof of residency. In 2009, the global partnership on output-based aid (GPOBA) approved a pilot project for 1.652 million dollars with the objective of increasing access to safe electricity supply in Indian slums through targeted output-based subsides. The pilot focused on selected urban slum areas of Mumbai, but had potential for scale-up in other communities in Mumbai and across India if successfully implemented. The slum rehabilitation society reported that many households expressed willingness to connect under the project, but were unwilling to pay the required end-user contribution. During the life of the project, Reliance (RIL) made about 7,000 new connections in Shivaji Nagar (outside of the OBA subsidy scheme); households used local electricians to install wiring that did not necessarily conform with the technical standards required by the project but cost significantly less},

	abstract = {The Government of Bangladesh, with help from the
World Bank and other donors, has provided aid to
a local agency called Infrastructure Development
Company Limited and its partner organizations to
devise a credit scheme for marketing solar home system
units and making these an affordable alternative to grid
electricity for poor people in remote areas. This paper
uses household survey data to examine the financing
scheme behind the dissemination of these solar home
systems, in particular the role of the subsidy; the
factors that determine the adoption of the systems
in rural Bangladesh; and the welfare impacts of such
adoption. The paper finds that while the subsidy has
been declining over time, the demand for solar home
systems has seen phenomenal growth, mostly because of technological developments that have made the systems
increasingly more affordable. Households with better
physical and educational endowments are more likely
to adopt solar home systems than poor households.
The price of the system matters in household decision
making—a 10 percent decline in the price of the system
increases the overall demand for a solar panel by 2
percent. As for the benefits, adoption of a solar home
system improves children’s evening study time, lowers
kerosene consumption, and provides health benefits for
household members, in particular for women. It is also
found to increase women’s decision-making ability in
certain household affairs. Finally, it is found to increase
household consumption expenditure, although at a small
scale.},

This paper reports mid-term results of a World Bank Global Program for Output Based Aid (GPOBA) subsidized expansion of public piped water points into slum and peri-urban areas of Kampala, Uganda. The project funded public and private yard taps, as well as two types of public water points (PWPs) that each serve up to 30 households. We provide preliminary evidence on two related objectives. We estimate the impact of an increase in the supply of cleaner piped water on the health and well-being of beneficiaries using the staggered nature of infrastructure roll-out. Despite the very slow implementation of the project, we find that the program had a substantive impact on households’ access to water: both distance to water source and price of a standard container fall. These improvements in access do not translate into increases in reported volumes of water consumed. However, we document large time savings associated with the project, particularly for adults. The mid-line results on illness are surprising, albeit too preliminary to be conclusive: the likelihood of self-reported illness in the past two weeks is higher in program areas. Furthermore, the increase in illness incidence is not driven by diarrheal diseases. Finally, we document an increase in the rental value of household units, that potentially reflects the capitalized value of the gains due to the program.},

	abstract = {This report originated as a contribution to the “Program of Integrated Public Policies for the Youth,” through which the IDB is supporting the Brazilian Municipality of Fortaleza in fostering socio-economic inclusion for young people in disadvantaged contexts. 
The first contribution of the study is to offer a synthetic outline of the issues and challenges relative to social and productive exclusion of young people, distinguishing between developed and developing regions, with special attention to Brazil. The report identifies and outlines, with empirical evidence, the following five macro-challenges that youth employment currently poses to countries like Brazil. Namely: (a) insufficient educational attainment and quality; (b) poverty, vulnerability, and youth at risk; (c) mismatch in labor supply and demand; (d) lack of opportunities and high incidence of informality; and (e) expected labor market effects of the ongoing crisis.
Against such a framework, the study identifies and describes eight worldwide best practices in the field of youth employment policies. The choice of the case studies maintains an explicit focus on programs with an emphasis on the promotion of self-employment and entrepreneurship as alternative tools to tap an existing under-exploited young entrepreneurial potential, in a context of shrinking labor demand from the public and formal sector. 
The identified most successful and sustainable programs (retrieved in a variety of different contexts) consistently show some common key success factors. In particular, they exhibit an emphasis on selection and targeting (according to age, education level, and access to credit, business networks, and tools); a “person-centered” approach (as opposed to “product-” or “policy-centered”); and a proper combination of business-related and training initiatives. A documented barrier is often the lack of coordination between public agencies, at different levels, with the private sector and local civil society representatives. Additionally, in the Brazilian context, it seems utterly important to balance efforts between measures that increase the labor welfare for all, while simultaneously striving to improve the business environment and incentivize microenterprises to register.},

	abstract = {Cities in the developing world are rapidly expanding, boosting countries’ economies, reducing poverty, and fueling global prosperity. But as more people, assets, and economic activity become concentrated in cities, and infrastructure struggles to keep up with rapid growth, the risk posed by natural disasters and climate change is rising. The urban poor – who are most exposed and least able to cope – will be hardest hit, with up to 77 million urban residents potentially falling back into poverty as a result of climate change alone. To help the urban poor unlock their full economic potential and protect hard-won development gains, the report discusses the need to invest in urban resilience. Over the next 15 years, at least 400 billion dollars will be needed each year to make city infrastructure low-emissions and more resilient to the wide range of shocks and stresses that cities may encounter. The flagship report -- co-authored by the World Bank Group and the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery -- illustrates how building urban resilience is critical to reducing poverty and promoting shared prosperity. And while, over the last five years, the World Bank Group has financed more than \$9 billion in projects to help cities in 41 countries become more resilient, significant investment gaps remain. To overcome these gaps, the World Bank Group and other multilateral development institutions can play a critical role in enabling city and national governments leverage private},

As a result, urbanization in South Asia remains underleveraged in its ability to deliver widespread improvements in both prosperity and livability. 
 
 Leveraging Urbanization in South Asia is about the state of South Asia's urbanization and the market and policy failures that have taken the region’s urban areas to where they are today--and the hard policy actions needed if the region’s cities are to leverage urbanization better. This publication provides original empirical and diagnostic analysis of urbanization and related economic trends in the region. It also discusses in detail the key policy areas, the most fundamental being urban governance and finance, where actions must be taken to make cities more prosperous and livable.},

	abstract = {This study was made possible by the financial contribution of the Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP) and the Water Partnership Program (WPP). ESMAP is a global knowledge and technical assistance program for low- and middle-income countries to increase their know-how and institutional capacity to achieve environmentally sustainable energy solutions for poverty reduction and economic growth. WPP is a global partnership for improved water resources management and water service delivery. The World Bank Group administers both programs.
The study was prepared by the Water Environment \& Reuse Foundation (WE\&RF) under Contract No. 7171721 with the World Bank Group. The research was largely enabled by WE\&RF’s partner institutions for this study: La Universidad de los Andes, Colombia, and Natural Systems Utilities, United States and Colombia. Without their dedication to the project through the discussion of ideas, connecting WE\&RF with utilities and experts, and reviewing draft materials, this work would not have been possible. Their local expertise on issues facing Latin American utilities added perspective and depth to the project.
The research team would like to thank the following individuals from the World Bank Group for their time and direction to this project: Carmen Yee-Batista, Jean-Martin Brault, and Lara Chinarro. Thank you to Elvira Broeks and Pamela Duran for their help with logistics and to Inge Pakulski, editor, for her dedication and support in finalizing this report.
The research team also thanks Allison Deines of WE\&RF for her assistance with translation, Lola Olabode of WE\&RF for her early work on the project, and Tsenguun Tumurkhuyag, WE\&RF intern, for her contributions. Thank you to Jaime Alba of DC Water for his review of our work and translations. Special thanks to Nelson Castaño and others at the Asociación Colombiana de Ingeniería Sanitaria y Ambiental (ACODAL) for their collaboration on the Regional Workshop that helped inform the research of this project. Thank you to Barry Liner and the Water Environment Federation for their support and review of this project.
Finally, thank you to all the utilities in Latin America and the Caribbean who generously shared their experiences and pointed the research team to various resources and data. Their knowledge helped shape and strengthen this research effort. Special thanks to the water and wastewater utilities who spent additional time serving as case studies for this project. Their participation provided valuable insight for this report and all utilities seeking to achieve energy efficiency and recovery.},

	title = {Assessing the performance of targeting mechanisms},
	abstract = {A policy intervention entails a distribution of social resources to a target population in order to solve a particular problem they face. In that context, targeting is designed to assign treatment according to some eligibility criterion. While eﬀective targeting is not an end in itself, it is central to both fairness and cost-eﬀectiveness in policymaking. Decision makers and other stakeholders would therefore like to know the extent to which targeting respects eligibility. Answering this key question is essentially an exercise in associational inference. This paper proposes an evaluative framework for assessing targeting outcomes. The framework focuses on measuring, judging and explaining targeting performance. Among indicators of performance considered, the conditional probability of assignment emerges as a local measure which is more informative than global indicators. The paper advocates for the use of chance-corrected measures of interobserver agreement to judge the extent of agreement between assignment mechanisms, and demonstrates the use of bivariate probit regression analysis to identify proximate determinants of targeting outcomes. The proposed framework is applied to the evaluation of the targeting of cash transfers in the context of the Social Safety Nets Pilot Project (SSNPP) in Northern Cameroon.},

	abstract = {This study investigates how households value different water sources which include in-house and yard connections to water systems. Differentials in the value of in-house and yard connections across governance approaches (municipal, private and community-managed services) are also investigated. The empirical analysis involves estimating hedonic models of stated rental prices for a large sample of urban and rural households in Guatemala. Findings indicate that urban households value municipal and private services. Conversely, urban households do not value piped water when provided by a community-managed system. Rural households seem to be more concerned about the distance of their primary source than about the type of water source.},

	abstract = {Many studies have reported the effect of water supply, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) in improving health and ultimately alleviating poverty. Current coverage estimates show however that a large proportion of people in the world still do not have access to a simple pit latrine or a source of safe drinking water, and this situation worsens in rural areas. To help end these appalling figures, much effort has gone into the development of policy instruments which support decision-making, i.e. planning, targeting and prioritization. Indices and indicators are increasingly recognised as powerful tools for such purposes. This paper details the theoretical framework and development of a multidimensional, WASH-focused, thematic indicator: the WASH Poverty Index (WASH PI). It describes the methodology in index construction and disseminates achieved results in a variety of forms to promote the utility of the tool for the integrated analysis of WASH and poverty linkages. The article uses Kenya as initial case study to illustrate the application of the index. Overall, WASH PI helps identify priority areas and guide appropriate action and policy-making towards improved service delivery.},

With sensors and analytic tools deployed island-wide to provide a real-time monitoring and decision support system, the Smart Water Grid system enables PUB to manage the water supply network efficiently, ensuring that all Singaporeans will continue to enjoy a reliable and sustainable water supply for generations to come. This paper covers the five key aspects of the Smart Water Grid system, in relation to both the key operational aspects of a water distribution system (asset management, leak management, water quality monitoring) and the customers' end (automated meter reading and water conservation). For each aspect, the paper focuses on the challenges, current technology, PUB's experience with technology and identified gaps, and the technology roadmap.},

The aim of this research is to provide infrastructure planners with a detailed understanding of how granular data generated by an intelligent water management system (Autoﬂow©) can be utilised to obtain signiﬁcant efﬁciencies throughout different stages of an urban water cycle, from supply, distribution, customer engagement, and even wastewater treatment.},

The enzyme specifically hydrolyzed phosphatidylinositol, but did not act on phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine and sphingomyelin, under the conditions examined. The products from phosphatidylinositol of enzyme reaction were diacylglycerols and a mixture of myoinositol 1- and 1, 2-cyclic phosphates, suggesting that the enzyme was a phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C. The enzyme released alkaline phosphatase quantitatively from rat kidney slices. A kinetic analysis was made on the release of alkaline phosphatase. The results suggest that phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C can specifically act on plasma membrane of rat kidney slices.},

	abstract = {Little is known about innovation in developing countries, partly because of the lack of comparable and reliable data. Collecting data on firm-level innovation is challenging because of the subjective definition of what determines an innovation, a problem that is exacerbated in devel- oping countries where innovation is likely to be more incremental and less radical. This paper contributes to the literature by presenting the results of an experiment
aiming to identify the survey instrument that better cap- tures firm-level innovation in developing countries. The paper shows that a small set of questions included in a multi-topic, firm-level survey does not provide an accurate picture of firm-level innovation and tends to overestimate innovation rates. Issues related to framing explain some of the unreliability of innovation responses, while cog- nitive problems do not appear to play a significant role.},
