	title = {What is the Evidence on Top-down and Bottom-up Approaches in Improving Access to Water, Sanitation and Electricity Services in Low-income or Informal Settlements},
	abstract = {This systematic review of urban planning studies in developing countries found that top-down efforts are ineffective for connecting populations to centralised water, sanitation or electricity services. Bottom up, participatory approaches are effective for local sanitation solutions, but not for water supply or connectivity to other services.
Services provided by public or private agencies through centralised planning and implementation (top-down) appeared effective in individual studies for connecting populations to water, sanitation and electricity. However, where studies were sufficiently similar to justify pooling findings in a statistical meta-analysis, this conclusion was not confirmed. Qualitative synthesis of contextual factors suggest a need for the customisation of solutions to meet local needs, and better delivery of services by alternative/non-government service providers.
Participatory (bottom-up) approaches adopted by {NGOs} and {CBOs} suit the construction and maintenance of toilets, which can be standalone, and statistical meta-analysis confirms their effectiveness for individual but not community toilets. Although studies of bottom-up approaches to improving water access appeared positive more often than studies of top down approaches, this difference was not statistically significant in a meta-analysis. Moreover, bottom-up approaches suffer from problems of scaling-up. Replication of successful models may not always be possible, since the same conditions may not be present in different locations.
Neighbourhoods without security of tenure are rarely served well top-down. Bottom-up approaches are also limited in this context, and also in Africa where efforts may be hampered by particularly modest levels of economic development. Public-private partnerships show promise for top-down approaches to improving water supply. Bottom-up, {NGO} led initiatives for improving water supply need the cooperation and support of the public sector.},

	abstract = {Given the broad array of issues and
 the complexity faced by the water sector as a whole (from
 irrigation to flood protection, to water conservation and
 hydropower), there is great demand for future exploring the
 potential of {RBF} and tackling the questions still unanswered
 about many of its operational dimensions. This document
 takes a closer look at some of the practical aspects of
 implementing various {RBF} water schemes. Chapter 2 provides
 an analytical framework to explore if and when {RBF} can be a
 viable option, shedding light on some key factors and
 preconditions that are necessary for {RBF} to work--with the
 understanding that it can be used either as an alternative
 or a complement to a more traditional input-based funding
 scheme. Chapter 3 then revisits the concepts discussed in
 the analytical framework through the analysis of various
 case studies of {RBF} approaches in different water-related
 areas. Some of the case studies are based on actual projects
 already implemented or ongoing, while others are an
 illustrative elaboration, given the lack of practical cases
 to use as sources. Chapter 4 presents some conclusions and
 lessons learned. The key challenges that are likely to be
 encountered in designing an {RBF} scheme deal with: the
 clarity and level of certainty of the relationships from
 input to output to outcomes (causal links); the ease and
 availability of measurable indicators; and, consequently,
 the optimal determination of the necessary incentive(s) to
 align the goals of the principal with the agents'
 deliverables. Appendix A presents a glossary of {RBF} concepts
 and acronyms. Appendix B presents specific results and
 indicators which may be relevant for different sectors.},

	abstract = {In Brazilian urban favelas, the development of informal connections is common,
relatively easy to obtain, and allow citizens to acquire electricity eluding or reducing
the regular charging of consumption. Genuine affordability problems and limited
means of subsistence are the most important but not exhaustive explanation of theft
and nonpayment problems afflicting energy distribution companies. With a preliminary
evaluation of the project “Conviver: energia para viver melhor”, implemented in Belo
Horizonte, this thesis studies the determinants of illegal connections and energy fraud
in the context of low-income urban favelas. Using the tecnique of logistic regression,
the study illustrates how the probability of engaging in illegal behavior is explained by
the following concurring factors: inadequate energy provision and lacking equipment;
income and affordability; inefficient and incorrect use of domestic electric appliances.
Additionally, based on the Conviver sample of 15,279 households, the thesis provides
an evaluation of the effectiveness of different pro-poor schemes (government poverty
subsidies and electricity block tariffs) at subsidizing energy costs for poor customers.
The analysis proves that social tariffs, even though not exclusively responsible, can be
considered as factors that mitigate the occurrence of illegality. The type of social tariffs
that work better are the ones that are more strictly connected to consumption, as
opposed to those linked to poverty subsidies. This make a strong case for a “tariff
engineering” that takes into serious account the electricity needs in term of
consumption, and try to segment the customers to realistically match the actual needs
(minimum; low-medium; houses with micro-businesses in the dwelling). As the
preliminary outcomes of the Conviver program document, the positive effect of propoor
tariff schemes will be even multiplied if combined with effort for the orientation
of low-income customers to energy-saving behaviors.},

	abstract = {Indian cities have large populations of urban slum dwellers who lack access to basic services from utility providers. Many households obtain access to electricity through illegal connections, which can be unsafe and contribute to commercial distribution losses at utilities. To address this challenge, the Indian electricity act of 2003 introduced a provision to increase formal access by requiring electric utilities to connect and supply any customer who can provide proof of residency. In 2009, the global partnership on output-based aid ({GPOBA}) approved a pilot project for 1.652 million dollars with the objective of increasing access to safe electricity supply in Indian slums through targeted output-based subsides. The pilot focused on selected urban slum areas of Mumbai, but had potential for scale-up in other communities in Mumbai and across India if successfully implemented. The slum rehabilitation society reported that many households expressed willingness to connect under the project, but were unwilling to pay the required end-user contribution. During the life of the project, Reliance ({RIL}) made about 7,000 new connections in Shivaji Nagar (outside of the {OBA} subsidy scheme); households used local electricians to install wiring that did not necessarily conform with the technical standards required by the project but cost significantly less},

	abstract = {The Government of Bangladesh, with help from the
World Bank and other donors, has provided aid to
a local agency called Infrastructure Development
Company Limited and its partner organizations to
devise a credit scheme for marketing solar home system
units and making these an affordable alternative to grid
electricity for poor people in remote areas. This paper
uses household survey data to examine the financing
scheme behind the dissemination of these solar home
systems, in particular the role of the subsidy; the
factors that determine the adoption of the systems
in rural Bangladesh; and the welfare impacts of such
adoption. The paper finds that while the subsidy has
been declining over time, the demand for solar home
systems has seen phenomenal growth, mostly because of technological developments that have made the systems
increasingly more affordable. Households with better
physical and educational endowments are more likely
to adopt solar home systems than poor households.
The price of the system matters in household decision
making—a 10 percent decline in the price of the system
increases the overall demand for a solar panel by 2
percent. As for the benefits, adoption of a solar home
system improves children’s evening study time, lowers
kerosene consumption, and provides health benefits for
household members, in particular for women. It is also
found to increase women’s decision-making ability in
certain household affairs. Finally, it is found to increase
household consumption expenditure, although at a small
scale.},

	rights = {All rights reserved},
	abstract = {This report originated as a contribution to the “Program of Integrated Public Policies for the Youth,” through which the {IDB} is supporting the Brazilian Municipality of Fortaleza in fostering socio-economic inclusion for young people in disadvantaged contexts. 
The first contribution of the study is to offer a synthetic outline of the issues and challenges relative to social and productive exclusion of young people, distinguishing between developed and developing regions, with special attention to Brazil. The report identifies and outlines, with empirical evidence, the following five macro-challenges that youth employment currently poses to countries like Brazil. Namely: (a) insufficient educational attainment and quality; (b) poverty, vulnerability, and youth at risk; (c) mismatch in labor supply and demand; (d) lack of opportunities and high incidence of informality; and (e) expected labor market effects of the ongoing crisis.
Against such a framework, the study identifies and describes eight worldwide best practices in the field of youth employment policies. The choice of the case studies maintains an explicit focus on programs with an emphasis on the promotion of self-employment and entrepreneurship as alternative tools to tap an existing under-exploited young entrepreneurial potential, in a context of shrinking labor demand from the public and formal sector. 
The identified most successful and sustainable programs (retrieved in a variety of different contexts) consistently show some common key success factors. In particular, they exhibit an emphasis on selection and targeting (according to age, education level, and access to credit, business networks, and tools); a “person-centered” approach (as opposed to “product-” or “policy-centered”); and a proper combination of business-related and training initiatives. A documented barrier is often the lack of coordination between public agencies, at different levels, with the private sector and local civil society representatives. Additionally, in the Brazilian context, it seems utterly important to balance efforts between measures that increase the labor welfare for all, while simultaneously striving to improve the business environment and incentivize microenterprises to register.},

	abstract = {Delivering water supply to the urban poor is challenging. Weak property rights, high residential mobility and other agency problems raise the costs of clean water services provision. This paper reports mid-term results of a World Bank Global Program for Output Based Aid ({GPOBA}) subsidized expansion of public piped water points into slum and peri-urban areas of Kampala, Uganda. The project funded public and private yard taps, as well as two types of public water points ({PWPs}) that each serve up to 30 households. We provide preliminary evidence on two related objectives. We estimate the impact of an increase in the supply of cleaner piped water on the health and well-being of beneficiaries using the staggered nature of infrastructure roll-out. Despite the very slow implementation of the project, we find that the program had a substantive impact on households’ access to water: both distance to water source and price of a standard container fall. These improvements in access do not translate into increases in reported volumes of water consumed. However, we document large time savings associated with the project, particularly for adults. The mid-line results on illness are surprising, albeit too preliminary to be conclusive: the likelihood of self-reported illness in the past two weeks is higher in program areas. Furthermore, the increase in illness incidence is not driven by diarrheal diseases. Finally, we document an increase in the rental value of household units, that potentially reflects the capitalized value of the gains due to the program.},

It is therefore essential that the utilities provide a methodology to assess the capability of a residential consumer to pay on time his/her electricity bill. As such, the utility will be able to simulate strategies and mitigate the risk of non-payment. This article presents a proposal based on fuzzy logic approach to compute a \&ldquo;Payment Capability Index\&rdquo; ({PCI}) for residential customers. A spatial view of {PCI} is provided by illustrative maps obtained by Geographic Information System ({GIS}).},

	shorttitle = {Investing in urban resilience},
	abstract = {Cities in the developing world are rapidly expanding, boosting countries’ economies, reducing poverty, and fueling global prosperity. But as more people, assets, and economic activity become concentrated in cities, and infrastructure struggles to keep up with rapid growth, the risk posed by natural disasters and climate change is rising. The urban poor – who are most exposed and least able to cope – will be hardest hit, with up to 77 million urban residents potentially falling back into poverty as a result of climate change alone. To help the urban poor unlock their full economic potential and protect hard-won development gains, the report discusses the need to invest in urban resilience. Over the next 15 years, at least 400 billion dollars will be needed each year to make city infrastructure low-emissions and more resilient to the wide range of shocks and stresses that cities may encounter. The flagship report -- co-authored by the World Bank Group and the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery -- illustrates how building urban resilience is critical to reducing poverty and promoting shared prosperity. And while, over the last five years, the World Bank Group has financed more than \$9 billion in projects to help cities in 41 countries become more resilient, significant investment gaps remain. To overcome these gaps, the World Bank Group and other multilateral development institutions can play a critical role in enabling city and national governments leverage private},
